　　在没有手机短信之前，每逢节日，邮政部门对海啸般的贺片而忙碌。贺片上总是写着几个亲笔字。即使已经印制的深情的话，也会有发信人所写的地址姓名。你至少可以看到发信人的亲笔字。我虽然对那五元以上的贺片感到不以为然，但一些得意门生的贺片还是保留了一部分。当然，我很清楚，在贺片年代，那越来越昂贵的贺片早已把那份深情打了大大的折，至少是八折。
Mother in the wheat mature season is always fidgeting, blossom in wheat and Shouting, the harvester roared through fields and roads, I can feel her sadness.
Anyone a famous saying "guess".
This "benevolence" this "wisdom" is all in the heart.
Good article is ultimately want to impress people, or give what people left.
This move does not necessarily have to be like earlier give a person with shock, this kind of leave, also don't have to be valuable.
As long as can make readers heart as you tip flow, to like what you like, sorrow you sorrow, entertainment you have entertainment, enlightenment you see...
All can share with you, there would be enough.
I have been think so.
Time of this worm wake NiaoTi season, enjoy spring the insect series, has a lasting appeal.
This series of every article I carefully read.
In these articles, you can't find any whitewash, deliberate, only pure and fresh, nature and interest.
The stimulation of insect subject matter itself is not the sort of secular, but in the author's yi yi is unripe brightness, attracted numerous readers.
So, when you see the influential magazine at the provincial level "northern literature" in the third phase of the overall grand launch Korea spring for more than sixteen thousand words of 11 series essays insects "in paradise, I'm not surprised, feel is understandable.
Just sincerely happy for the author.
In today's materialistic, some vulgar, cater to fill in the field of literature media cases, also can have the publication to the internal qualities of these close to literature works gave full affirmation and at the forum, and I can't help but friends are interested in pure literature to be pleased, more deep inside the editor deeply admire the great eye.
Through the series, the insect feel Korea's spring writing way and the method of Boolean "insects to record", Zhou Xiaofeng "insects" is obvious different, he doesn't have to follow famous celebrities, is not simply to introduce insects, but with a unique style, profound thoughts, exquisite and pure and fresh, live flesh to write fun and tong qu, and comes in and put the two together, show originality.
In the seed insect, for example, when I was a child because the author of naughty harrow, forget to add fire pond oven, made rawish meal, got mother's play, sister or obstinate refused to eat, the in the mind is full of injustice, and unhappiness, "...
But as you no feeling no mood a person sit at the gate of the pan to reflect on their own time, under the haystack, and climbed out of a seed, you stretch out his hand to catch in their hands, cut grass stick inserted on its tail tip, looking at it dragged grass stick around with funny, a kind of simple happiness soon hit all over your body, mother pulled the ear pain, sister didn't eat unhappy all vanished into thin air."
This description is exquisite, real and vivid.
Children's happiness is so simple, it is so easy to meet, although there is no more rendering, worm and children wu of scenery is fleshed out, people resistant finish.
More than this article, the entire series, children's and two clues tightly wound, insect boring cause of tong qu, tong qu from worms, "children's dance one bug" scene is like a clear spring water, "pure and beautiful", formed the unique style of the author himself.
Not only the success of the unique style is the author insect series, the detailed descriptions of the author and also very impressive.
In pesticide medicine undead, authorities in the village that doesn't take the screw thread of drought encounter predators, the author wrote, "at the end of the day it's getting dark, I see it as usual, there was a flash of light from the front and a firefly carrying a lantern.
See this visitor only took out fine such as hair two pieces of the jaw, bend over to become a sharp hooks, politely in dry screw thread on the outer membrane of knocked, like gently knocking at the door, and in intimate kissing, only five or six, just see this volume is greater than its many of dry screw screw wiggling excitedly with a body, was motionless, tentacles soft collapse set off down, like a piece of cloth on my soft.
The guest is a light kiss, master soon became a beach meat porridge.
What is really good, I know I couldn't get the good stuff to entertain guest, put out your body.
Guest is honest you're welcome, jump up in the air the graceful dance, happy, sleek lines convey information: come on come on, the host is polite, everyone come to visit.
So small lanterns YiZhanZhan followed, the fireflies are invited to the dinner eat mellow.
Early the next morning, when I pick up shells cicada again after uncle's house, found a snail shells, inside and outside clean, no residual."
This paragraph, the author USES the exquisite brushwork, vividly described the firefly nibbled dry screw screw in this scene, the fun, cheered the stereo sense is the image in front of the eyes of readers.
Two elves are human, be written lived, they deduce the insect world a real, little-known story.
Valuable is that content description is exquisite and not procrastinating, vivid and not sensational, relaxed, witty language narration is an astounding.
Understatement, but it can catch the heart, give the reader a deep impression.
In fact, the author fine brushwork is not just in the back shell of the dry screw thread here, emphatically the Qing dish of the grinding worm, luminous sensational "fireflies", of the mantis and murder, sing a little musician "cicada", in the insect world beauty "dragonfly", "female 18 change" "bean Dan", also has the "elbow turn out" and "soil dog son" small "bee" brewing of the sweetness of life, etc., are all reveal the author delicate feelings.
Especially some work elf brush strokes, in imperceptible in, the reader back to that day really lively, the insects were deeply obsessed with childhood.
Northern literature magazine editor in the writing in the previous special recommend said: "the writer, with exquisite and moving of the brush will be personified nature biology, back to childhood,...
"The authors have such effect, and, of course he rich literary heritage inseparable, but I think more important still is his love of life, love of life.
In life observant, good at discovering, and can realize carefully the elf's joys and sorrows, with rigorous thinking, to refine simulations of surface of life, then in the freely control the ability of language, incisively and vividly express out true meaning of nature.
The author feel about the insect world is unique, and is pure, is also good.
At the same time also give readers the feeling conduction, resonate.
As the northern literature editor fully affirmed, "with all sorts of pure feeling, let a person to return to the childhood time, let a child witness everything, make readers and the author got the appreciation and happy together, pure and good."
Nature, the pure and happy to share, I have selected segments of the author of the original article, produced MTV courseware, no contact with students from the description of the author's understanding of nature of the insect world colorful, they imagine the surprise of the nature has given, appreciate the bringing happiness to the human nature.
At the same time, the students also enjoy the aesthetic feeling, from the author's language learnt the nutrition rich literature.
So here, I also should say thank you.
Also hope that heaven all the insects in the cheerful cry awakened, always be with people.
